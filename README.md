# Russian Flashcards React.js: Description

This project is a port of an web application that I wrote for 
[project 2](https://github.com/scottlurowist/russian_flashcards-web-app) of 
[General Assembly's SEI program](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/new-york-city).
I chose to due Russian Flashcards because I speak Russian and have friends in Russia who
would like to use this app.

One twist on the flashcards is that it is requires typing. I know as a language learning
enthusiast that learning a language involves using as many senses as you can. So I require
users to type either English or Russian rather than simply "flipping a card".

The port is from a web app using vanilla JavaScript,jQuery, SCSS, and HTML to React.js.
You can read about my
[design decisions](https://github.com/scottlurowist/russian_flashcards-web-app#readme) 
with respect to the first project. I chose to deviate from the GA provided template and
write my own MVC-light framework with a view state controller since the project requirements
stated that the app must be an SPA. This app reflects how I would build an app under
those General Assembly requirements, based upon my knowledge gained from a Masters in
Computer Science and my real-world software development experience.

With this port, I am free to do things the way that I would want to do them using React.js
and React Bootstrap.

The application communicates with a backend web API implemented with Express.js,
Mongoose.js, MongoDB, and of course Node.js. I implemented the backend and it is deployed to Heroku.

### Technologies Directly Used

- JavaScript
- React.js using JSX and React Bootstrap
- React.js scaffolding using "create-react-app"
